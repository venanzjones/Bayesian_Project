# Ozone pollution in the Po valley 

### Intro  
This is the official repository of the Bayesian Statistics project about Ozone pollution in Po valley, tutored by Michela Frigeri.
A work by Matteo Coppellotti, Alessandro Ganelli, Francesco Maria Mancinelli, Leonardo Marchesin, Beatrice Sisti and Alessandro Venanzi.
Code is developed via Rstudio, python and STAN.
Data is provided from Azienda Regionale per la Protezione Ambientale (ARPA).

### Metodologies 
We want to define a spatioâ€“temporal Bayesian model to understand the behavior of $O_3$ over the years (May-October 2010-2023), exploiting Stan for MCMC implementation.
Taking into account the spatial correlation among stations will be the final focus of this project.
